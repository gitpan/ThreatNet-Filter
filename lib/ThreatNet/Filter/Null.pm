=head1 NAME

ThreatNet::Filter::Null - ThreatNet Filter to discard all messages

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The default C<ThreatNet::Filter> object returns true for all messages
passed to its C<keep> method, and can thus be used as a logical "true"
filter object if needed.

C<ThreatNet::Filter::Null> is a utility class which provides the logical
opposite of this. Calls to the C<keep> method for Null filter objects
B<always> return false.

Its the bit bucket of the ThreatNet Filter world.

=head1 METHODS

Methods are as for the parent L<ThreatNet::Filter> class.
